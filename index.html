              <div class="p2">
                <p> I use the combination of aural tuning and visual tuning (with the help of mordern computer technology) to tune each individula piano, optimizing the tone, harmonizing the detail with the whole, and maximizes stability. </p>
                <p> I calibrate the computer against the most accurate source of pitch that one can get, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), instead of a tuning fork, whose pitch changes slightly with the temperature and humidity. </p>
                <p> By Default, I use equal temperament (set A4 440) to tune your piano. However, if you choose to tune your piano in an unequal temperament, we have several doznes temperaments for you to choose.</p>
                <p> The first time I tune your piano, I will measure the inharmonicity of your piano, yielding a best-fit infarmonicity model and save it to a file. I will then use the comprehensive tuning file to tune your piano each time thereafter to the same pitch. </p>

          <h3><a name="frequency"></a><img src="img/bass.jpg" alt="" width="33" height="30" align="middle" />How Often should I tune my piano</h3>
          </p>
          <p class="style1">It depends upon its condition, the environment in which it is located, and the musical demands of the owner. A piano used mainly as a piece of furniture probably won't &quot;need&quot; to be tuned more than once a year. A piano that is played used regularly and is in good condition might get by with being tuned twice a year. A piano given a daily workout by a professional musician or serious student might need to be tuned monthly or even more frequently. -- quoted from <em>Piano Servicing, Tuning, and Rebuilding</em>, 2nd Edision, Page 239, by Authur A. Reblitz </p>
          <img class="img-responsive img-border-left" src="img/langlangAndCP.jpg" alt="">
          <h3><a name="outOfTune"></a><img src="img/bass.jpg" alt="" width="33" height="30" align="middle" />Why does a piano go out of tune?</h3>
          </p>
          <p class="style1">The main reason is the change of the humidity changes. The piano is made primarily of wood.  Being made of wood   the parts within the piano will shrink and swell with the humidity   changes.  In the summertime when the humidity levels are higher, the   piano keys may stick and the piano action will become sluggish.  In the   wintertime when the air is dryer, the piano keys seem to rattle when you   play them.  Therefore, the swelling and the shrinking affects the   piano's pinblock which keeps the piano tuning pins tight.  When the   piano pinblock absorbs moisture it swells, crushing the wood fibers   against the tuning pins, thus, the tuning pins begin to tighten raising   the pitch of the piano.  In the dry seasons, the wood shrinks away from   the tuning pins, loosening the tuning pins causing the strings to drop   in pitch. </p>
          <p class="style1">There are other factors which will change the tension of the strings and make the piano go out of tune. These factors include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="style1">Temperature -- direct sunlight, heat from fireplace, strong stage light will cause the changes of the pitches</li>
            <li class="style1">String Streching -- New strings has strong eleasticity and get streched at the first two years, casuing the drops in pitch.</li>
            <li class="style1">playing -- frequent hitting on the strings will cause the loose of the strings, reduce the tension of strings and changes the pitches. </li>
          </ul>
          <h3><a name="bestTime"></a><img src="img/bass.jpg" alt="" width="33" height="30" align="middle" />When is the best time to tune a piano?</h3>
          <p class="style1">If your piano has not been tuned in many years or has just been moved   between similar environments with similar humidity, any time is the   best time to bring your piano back to correct (concert) pitch. If the   piano has been moved out of or into an overly damp or dry environment it   is recommended that you wait 2-3 weeks to allow the piano to adjust.</p>
          <h3><a name="selling"></a><img src="img/bass.jpg" alt="" width="33" height="30" align="middle" />I'm thinking of selling my piano. Should I have it tuned? </h3>
          <p class="style1">Yes and no. Yes if you are selling to most of the normal potential buyers who will mainly judge your piano by the sound of your piano, you don't want to disappoint them by the poorly sound piano, a few stickey keys, broken strings, squeaky pedals.</p>
          <p class="style1"> No if your buyer is a piano dealer, rebuilder or some expert who will take the action out, check all the internal structure of your piano. And no need to tune it if you know it is un-tunable or the piano is only worth a few hundreds of dollars. </p>

              <h3> <a name="tuneMyself"></a><img src="img/bass.jpg" alt="" width="33" height="30" align="middle" />Can I tune my piano myself?</h3>
              <p class="style1">Possibly, If you are willing to take the time, and have the patience,   to learn how to do it properly. Warning: it's not as easy as it looks,   and there are some dangers. Tuning a piano is not a procedure to be   taken lightly, because you are dealing with over 200 piano strings that   have a combined total of 20 to 30 tons of tension. If you don't know   what you are doing you can break strings, break the piano's cast iron   frame, or  hurt yourself or others. However, if you conscientiously   study any of a number of authoritative books on the subject, or take a   course in piano tuning, and take the time to learn the proper technique,   it can be quite safe. </p>
              <p class="style1">Unless your piano tuner is just a rank beginner, he/she has probably   put in several years mastering the technique. If you don't know what a   piano in tune should sound like in the first place, it's going to be   rough learning. However, even if you do know what a piano in tune should   sound like, it doesn't necessarily make the task any easier, because   you will be able to hear  how far short of the mark your first tunings   fall. </p>
              <p class="style1">Piano tuning requires special tools, just like servicing new model   cars does. If you don't have the proper tools, you cannot hope to do a   satisfactory job. You cannot tune a piano with a normal socket or   adjustable wrench. If you attempt to do so, you will inevitably mar the   tuning pins, and make it difficult or impossible for anyone else to   subsequently tune the piano. You will need at the minimum a proper piano   tuning wrench (or tuning hammer, as it is called in the profession), a   tuning fork or other appropriate pitch reference, and a set of mutes to   silence the strings you are not tuning. And most importantly, incredible   patience. The tools themselves are not that expensive. Learning to use   them properly is, at least, in terms of the time involved. </p>
              <p class="style1">Remember that tuning a piano is an art and a skill, just like playing   the piano, acquired only after years of practice and study. It's not a   task that can be learned in a weekend. Your first attempts at tuning a   piano will be very frustrating, your first tuning will probably take you   over eight hours to do, and when you are done it will probably not last   very long or sound very good.  But after doing a dozen or more tunings   you may actually get to the point where the piano sounds better than it   did before you started. After doing a hundred or more tunings you may   actually be able to stand to listen to them. </p>

              <p class="style1">A grand piano action consists of about 60 parts. They work together in the following sequences:</p>
              <ol class="style1">
                <li>One presses the key, it moves down in front, raising the wippen, jack, hammer knuckle, shank and hammer.</li>
                <li>The key lifts the damper</li>
                <li>The jack disengages from the hammer knuckle when the jack toe engages with the letoff button</li>
                <li>The hammer hits the string and rebounds. </li>
                <li>The hammer depress the repetition level and the backcheck catches and hold the hammer tail</li>
                <li>When the front of the key raise a little from the bottom, the backcheck release hammer, permitting the repetition lever to lift the hammer until the jack returns under knuckle. The action is ready for another cycle, although the key hasn't returned all the way to its rest position (that is why you can repeats notes more quickly in a grand piano than in a upright piano.)</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="style1">The following picture illustrate how a grand piano action works. </p>

              <p class="style1">An upright action consists of roughly 60 parts. They work together in the following sequences:</p>
              <ol>
                <li class="style1">When one presses the key, it moves down, raise the sticker, wippen, jack and the hammer butt.</li>
                <li class="style1">Damper spoon    moves damper level, lifting damper from strings</li>
                <li class="style1">Jack disengages from hammer butt when jack toe engages letoff button</li>
                <li class="style1">Hammer hits strings and rebounds. Beackcheck catches butt catcher. When the key is released, all the parts return to their orginal positions</li>
